            <p>If your withdrawal request has been cancelled it can be one of two things; you haven’t submitted the proper documentation for verification process or you have accepted a bonus and haven’t completed the terms of the bonus.

            <p>(For further explanation, please refer to point 12 on Terms and Conditions page)</p>

            <p>12: To withdraw your funds, you will be asked to perform a trading volume of at least 30 times for each $1 bonus. Any funds in your account, including but not limited to your initial deposit, can be withdrawn only when the foregoing stipulation has been fully respected and fulfilled. Any attempt to withdrawal funds from an account made before completing the terms of the bonus will be immediately canceled and the request will be removed from the account.</p>
