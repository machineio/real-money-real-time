                    <p class="just-txt-packs lead marg-text-packs">With a market risk analyst available assigned throughout the month it will be easier to have one on one coaching sessions on a scheduled basis, and definitely start to gain an understanding of general characteristics of the market. A minimum of one to two weekly coaching sessions are included, and this is definitely a good start for those who have not chosen which package to go with yet. This is an easy way to figure out what package to start with as you begin to understand basic market terminology, and how to look for triggers in order to build correlations for strategic investments in the financial market. Market Risk Analysts may even walk through a couple trades per session to ensure the ideas are fully understood.</p>
