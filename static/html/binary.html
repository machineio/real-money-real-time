This is very important information to know when to establish an entry point as well as knowing when to exit an investment to reduce downside or to lock in profits as well. Additional time for enhancement hours can be purchased once the initial 20 hours included in the Intermediate package have been completed. By understanding the technical and fundamental side to your investments you will always be consistent, and you will definitely be making real money in real time!</p>
